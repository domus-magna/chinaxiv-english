# 🚨 CRITICAL: USE BD AT START OF EVERY TASK! 🚨
#
# BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE - STOP AND RUN: `bd ready`
# This shows you EXACTLY what to work on next. Dependencies matter!
# Don't guess - let bd tell you what's actually ready. This prevents:
# ❌ Wasted time on blocked tasks
# ❌ Missing critical dependencies
# ❌ Context switching chaos
# ✅ Crystal clear priorities
# ✅ Smooth dependency flow
# ✅ Organized, predictable progress
#
# Make this your unbreakable habit: TASK → `bd ready` → WORK → `bd update`
